<div><strong>COVID-19 spread is emotionally challenging for many people, changing day-to-day life in unprecedented ways.&nbsp;All sections of society &ndash; including employers, employees, and students &ndash; should play a role to protect themselves and each other and help prevent further spread of the disease.&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>&nbsp;<span style="color: #444444;">- World&nbsp;Health Organization</span></strong>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>On the basis of the current situation, we have realized that many parents are hesitating to send their children to school because they feel like schools are not the safest place to be. They are prioritizing their children's health over education. Our solution could help in ensuring that school is safe for students and staff members, not only for this period but also in the future. we must follow this safety culture in daily&nbsp;routine!</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>The helping solution is -&nbsp; according&nbsp;to WHO wearing masks are a necessary precaution for maintaining a safe environment.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div><strong>Our solution could detect if anyone is polluting this safe environment by not wearing a mask inside the premises&nbsp;of the school.</strong>&nbsp;We are using state-of-the-art Deep Learning Neural Network architectures for image processing and computer vision tasks that can detect anomalies better than human eyes. Our solution is&nbsp;<strong>remotely&nbsp;accessible through any</strong>&nbsp;<strong>mobile application</strong>&nbsp;and also capable of managing all the information and computation.</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<div>Our current model results look like -&nbsp;</div>

</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div>Our architecture is capable of integrating more custom functionalities on the top of the current detection models, such as -&nbsp;</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Social Distancing&nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
<li>Uniform Validation&nbsp;</li>
<li>Any other anomaly based on the use case</li>
</ul>
